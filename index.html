        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <p>Porter Robinson is a producer and DJ from North Carolina. Since 2005, he's created a portfolio of unique and
          groundbreaking electronic music. His first studio album, <b>Worlds</b> (2014), peaked at #1 on Billboard's Top
          Dance/Electronic Albums. </p>
        <p>Since then, Robinson has made the rounds worldwide. In 2017, he and long-time friend/fellow
          producer Madeon released their single <b>Shelter</b> which, along with its music video, took the Internet by
          storm. </p>
        <p>Known for experimenting with music, Robinson created <b>Virtual Self</b> in 2017, a hard
          trance/eurodance-inspired project that hearkened back to music of the late 90s and early 2000s.</p>
        <p>Robinson's second studio album, <b>Nurture</b>, is set to release in 2020. Two singles from the album, <b>Get
            Your Wish</b> and <b>Something Comforting</b>, have given fans a hint as to his new musical and visual
          direction.</p>
